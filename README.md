Cooling circuit

Water acts as a coolant in the circuit. A coolant jacket will surround the motors and the motor controllers.
We have considered the ideal cases in which total heat generated by components is being wholly transferred 
to the coolant during calculation.
The inlet water temperature is assumed to be 30 deg C considering a typical shiny day

For the battery, thermal management within the module consists of a long flat & straight metallic pipe that
loops through the module. The module is surrounded by coolant, like a capsule, to maximize the area of contact
between coolant and modules; modules are covered in thermal interface material, which provides electrical 
isolation between coolant & cells while still providing some level of heat transfer.
Coolant from jackets & the battery will take the heat released and run through the entire cooling course to 
become cold, and again reaches the motor, motor controller & battery, and in this way, the cycle continues.
Theoretically, our cooling system was able to dissipate approx 10.5kJ/s heat, which is equivalent to our
cooling load resulting in maintaining proper working temperature for all the components.
